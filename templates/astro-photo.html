<h1>Astrophotography</h1>
<p>I do astrophotography, I am not the best at it, but I am working on it!</p> 
<p>I use my Celestron SkyView Pro (EQ-5 is the generic name) mount with a Criterion RV-6 Dynascope as my main setup. I am working on getting it to be a "go-to" mount using the <a href=https://onstep.groups.io/g/main/wiki/3860">On-Step</a> controller.</p>
