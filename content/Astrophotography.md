Astrophotography is the art of taking images of space. I find it to be a relaxing, cold, and very enjoyable way to give people a glimpse into the stars without requiring them to come out to a telescope (but they totally should).

        <td>
            {{ img(src="./../imgs/Moonshot.bmp" alt="A zoomed in section of the moon at the edge between light and dark" w=600 h=400) }}

        <td>
            {{ img(src="./../imgs/moon II.bmp" alt="Wider field view of the moon, which is colorized by chromatic aberration" w=600 h=400) }}
        </td>
    </tr>

## What are Deep Sky Objects
Deep Sky Objects (DSO) are celestial bodies that are particularly far away or dim. These are often things like nebula and galaxies. 

## Why don't you image them, they look the coolest
I am working on it, however due to how dim DSOs are, you need the ability to track their positions very precisely to allow more particles of light to reach the camera's sensor. I am working on upgrading my telescope with this capability, but I'm not there yet.
