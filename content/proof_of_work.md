This website, is coded by me using the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) Static-Site-Generator, using the [Abridge](https://abridge.netlify.app/) theme. The website is hosted with ❤️ on Github Pages.

### Experience Using Zola
My experience using Zola has been largely good, however there a few major complaints I have about the system. 

- Using themes is hard...You have to specify to use the theme's version of index.html and page for every page you make. This inefficiency can make changing themes hard.
- Sections are hard to wrap your head around. I think most of the challenge comes down to section configuration being handled by a file called `_index.html`.
- The docs, are very clearly designed with a blog in mind...which is a benefit if you're making a blog. However, it's hard to apply that same structure to other kinds of web pages.

Despite these complaints, Zola and Abridge have made this project much easier. So thanks Zola and Abridge!
