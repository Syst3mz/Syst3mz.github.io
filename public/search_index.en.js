But what is parsing?\nParsing (and Lexing too!)\nParsing, in very brief, is taking some string of text and turning it into a something meaningful for the computer.\nMost often, this is an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). An AST is a tree where all information that is\nnot relevant to the further processing of some source is removed. Consider the following very complex\nexpression bellow:\n1 + (2 * 4)\n\nBefore we fall down the rabbit hole, let's first look at what the above expression would appear like as (one) AST.\n\nStructure of an AST\nOkay, this might look like a lot (and it is) but let's look at it's structure before panicking. The boxes are called nodes. Each node may have a number of children. The directional arrows indicate that\nthe node on the pointy end of the arrow is a child of the node at the flat end.\nBut What Does It Mean?\nNow, let's start from the top. We see a Binary node, this has no relation to the binary working in you computer; the Binary refers \nto the number of operands (children) the node has. The addition operation + adds a left hand number (in this case 1) to a right hand number.\nBut we don't have a number on the right hand side we have another Binary. That is okay, remember at this point \nwe are not doing any math just giving the input string more meaning for the computer. As a human, \nit's trivial to tell that the (2 * 4) should be done before the 1 + but the computer is not that smart.\nThe genius of the AST is that we can convey this \"do a before b\" thinking to the computer.\nWhen the computer eventually goes to evaluate the tree, the logic is pretty simple.\nint eval(Node n) {\n    if (n is Binary b) {\n        var lhs = eval(b.lhs);\n        var rhs = eval(b.rhs);\n        if(b.operator == Plus) {\n            return lhs + rhs;\n        }\n        else {\n            return lhs * rhs;\n        }\n    }\n    else {\n        var num = (Number)n;\n        return num.value;\n    }\n}\n\nThe recursive nature of eval is what gives us operator precedence. \nThe AST also does not have any of the parentheses, spaces or anything that is not strictly related to the operations\nthe computer needs to do to evaluate this expression. The parentheses meaning of \"do this first\" is encoded in the \nstructure of the tree.\nActually Making the Tree\nTaking the input expression(s) and turning them into an AST is the job of a parser and tokenizer.\nTokenizer/Lexer\nTokenizing has not been mentioned until now, but the tokenizer/lexer is a function that runs before the parser. It (somewhat unsurprisingly)\nturns the input data into a stream of tokens. Tokens are small pieces of a language that can be thought of as \"atomic.\"\nIn the expression above, a token stream would look like:\nNUMBER(1), PLUS, LPAREN, NUMBER(2), STAR, NUMBER(4), RPAREN.\nNow, for making the expression atomic it seems to have gotten...longer? That's because the tokens are \"atomic\" for the computer\nnot necessarily for us. At this point, we no longer have to think about strings, we can think about tokens! Oh, and all the spaces are gone.\nActually our tokenizer has the superpower of stripping away spaces (anyone who has worked with human text before knows how valuable this is).\nThis means that the token stream generated by 1+(2* 4) (note the missing spaces) is exactly the same as the token stream generated by 1 + (2 * 4): NUMBER(1), PLUS, LPAREN, NUMBER(2), STAR, NUMBER(4), RPAREN.\nParser\nOkay, we have our token stream in hand...what do we do with it? We hand that stream to the parser. The parser is a function\nwhich takes our token stream as input and produces an AST as output. There are quite a few methods to parse, so many in fact\nI think each one should get it's own page. For a good overview I can recommend this \nblog post by Chet Corcos.\n\nMy post on LR &amp; LALR\nLL\nRecursive Decent\n\n(This is not a complete list, just common parsers I have run into.)\n","id":"https://syst3mz.github.io/intro-to-parsing/","title":"Introduction to Parsing"},"https://syst3mz.github.io/lalr-generator/":{"body":"This page assumes you have read at least intro to parsing or know what parsing is.\nLR and by extension LALR parsers are a type of parser which creates the AST bottom up, and reads the input left-to-right.\nA Quick Note on Notation\nS -&gt; A \"c\"\nA -&gt; \"ab\"\n\nWhat are you looking at?

To meet that goal Nimbus will make sacrifices to its safety and run-time speed. I am writing Nimbus, not only as a learning experience, but to increase my productivity as a programmer.\nPlanned Features\nFamiliar Syntax\nfn fibbo(Int:n) -&gt; Int {\n    if n == 1 || n == 2 {\n        return 1\n    }\n\n    return fibbo(n-1) + fibbo(n-2)\n}\n\nSemicolons Only Where Needed\nNote in the above code sample, there are no semicolons. Code blocks and other \"self-ending\" language constructs can be \nsemicolon free.\nOptional and Result Type Syntax\nAny type can be made optional with the addition of a ?. For example:\nint: alwaysValue = 2 // There is always a non-none value in alwaysValue\nint?: maybe = 2 // An option type with a value\nint?: no = None // An option type with no value\n\nThe same syntax can be used to check if a value exists.\nmaybe = maybe? + 2\n\nIf there is no value in maybe and if the outer function can return an option, then None is immediately returned; otherwise \na ExpectedSome exception is thrown.\nGarbage Collection\nAutomatic Memory Management (AMM) is a must to support the goal of \"fast-to-write.\" Nimbus will use a garbage collector to handle AMM. Using a garbage collector lets the programmer focus on the program, not on complex move semantics or preventing memory cycles.\nMultiple Inheritance\nWhereas problems like the well studied diamond problem\nexist, the increase of re-usability in code that multiple inheritance can provide is well worth the challenges associated with multiple inheritance.\nFunction Level Structural Subtyping (Restricted Duck-Typing)\nTo supplement multiple inheritance, allowing functions to explicitly define what data they need to work \nwill allow a massive increase in re-usability.\n// syntax under heavy development!!!\nfn add_one&lt;T: T.Int:number&gt;(T:holder) {\n    holder.number += 1\n}\n\nTagged &amp; Generic Enums + Pattern Matching\nNimbus will rip Rust's excellent enums and pattern matching because they allow expressive and correct code.\nGradual Correctness\nThe Nimbus compiler will have multiple levels of safety with safer code requiring stricter compile-time checks. The programmer may chose to hack something together quickly using exceptions to handle errors. Later, they can come back switch a compiler flag, and the Nimbus compiler will enforce safety.\nCo-pilot Compiler\nFor the co-pilot, the compiler must be able to run in an \"interactive\" mode, where a file is watched and an AST is generated in real time for reporting to the IDE. It will provide fixes in real time as errors occur. The compiler should assume that the developer is wrong because as they are writing it, their code is almost certainly wrong. \nProgress\n\n\n    Nimbus's grammar (work in progress)\n\nprogram        -&gt; declaration+\n\nDeclarations\ndeclaration    -&gt; abstract? classDecl\n\t\t\t\t| fnDecl\n\t\t\t\t| varDecl\n\t\t\t\t| enumDecl\n\t\t\t\t| useDecl\n\nclassDecl      -&gt; \"class\" identifier (\"&lt;\" identifierl \"&gt;\")? inheritl? \"{\" classitem* \"}\"\ninherit        -&gt; \":\" (gtype | stype)\nclassitem      -&gt; amod classDecl\n                | amod fnDecl\n                | amod varDecl\n                | useDecl\n                \n\nfunDecl        -&gt; fn\n\nvarDecl        -&gt; \"imut\"? \"var\" (type \":\" )? identifier (\"=\" expression)?\n\nuseDecl        -&gt; \"use\" namespace (\"as\" identifier)?\nnamespace      -&gt; (identifier \".\")* identifier\n\nenumDecl       -&gt; \"enum\" identifier (\"&lt;\" identifierl \"&gt;\")? \"{\" varientl \"}\"\nvariant        -&gt; identifier (\"(\" typel \")\")\n\nStatements\nstatement      -&gt; exprStmt\n                | forStmt\n                | ifStmt\n                | returnStmt\n                | whileStmt\n                | block\n\nexprStmt       -&gt; expression \";\"\nforStmt        -&gt; \"for\" identifier \"in\" expression block\nifStmt         -&gt; if\nreturnStmt     -&gt; \"return\" expression?\nwhileStmt      -&gt; \"while\" expression block\nblock          -&gt; \"{\" (varDecl | statment)* expression?\"}\"\n\nExpressions\nexpression     -&gt; assignment\n                | if\n                \nif             -&gt; \"if\" expression block else?\nelse           -&gt; (\"else\" \"if\" expression block)* \"else\" block\n\nassignment     -&gt; ( call \".\" )? identifier \"=\" assignment\n               | logic_or\n\nlogic_or       -&gt; logic_and ( \"||\" logic_and )*\nlogic_and      -&gt; equality ( \"&amp;&amp;\" equality )*\nequality       -&gt; comparison ( ( \"!=\" | \"==\" ) comparison )*\ncomparison     -&gt; term ( ( \"&gt;\" | \"&gt;=\" | \"&lt;\" | \"&lt;=\" ) term )*\nterm           -&gt; factor ( ( \"-\" | \"+\" ) factor )*\nfactor         -&gt; unary ( ( \"/\" | \"*\" ) unary )*\n\nunary          -&gt; ( \"!\" | \"-\" ) unary | call \ncall           -&gt; primary ( \"(\" exprl \")\" | \".\" identifier )* \nprimary        -&gt; \"true\" \n                | \"false\" \n                | \"none\" \n                | \"this\"\n                | number \n                | string \n                | char\n                | identifier \n                | \"(\" expression \")\"\n                | \"super\" \".\" identifier \n\nAccess\nAccess modifiers are used to prohibit certain parts of code from being seen outside the \"inner\" scope of the instantiater.

He is well known for establishing the way planets moved around the sun with his laws of planetary motion. As it turns out, these laws can be applied to many non-planet celestial objects, and can accurately predict the position of objects in orbits. \nThis simulation was programmed using Kepler's laws. Click anywhere in the black box bellow to interact with the simulation. If you can't see it, grab a .exe version here.\n\n\n\nUse J to reduce the timescale, K to reset it to 10, L to increase the timescale.\nHolding shift will multiply the change by 10, holding z will multiply the change by 100, holding both will multiply the change by 1000.\nYou can note that as the red \"distance\" numbers increase, the speed of the planet decreases. This shows that my simulation is abiding by Kepler's laws which would predict that objects further from the body they are orbiting must be going slower.\nMore information About Orbits\nA great video about orbits, which helped serve as the foundation of this project can be found here It goes in to significant depth about the techniques used to simulate orbits, as well as being very well animated and voiced. They take this project much further than I have.\nAnother great video by Sebastian Lague can be found here.\nAnd I would of course be remiss not to include the Wikipedia page for Kepler's laws. \nTechnical Information About the Project\nI wrote this simulation in the Rust programming language because Rust is fast and portable. This simulation is not the most efficient simulation of planetary orbits, and the rendering of orbital paths is particularly in-efficient. The next task to improve this project would be to speed up the line drawing significantly. For graphics, I am using the Macroquad crate, which was perfect for this project because of its ability to compile to WASM allowing easy deployment to modern web browsers.\nHow does the simulation work?\nThe simulation is really a fancy equation solver. The equation I try to solve is $M = E - esin(E)$ Where $M$ is the mean anomaly, $E$ is the eccentric anomaly, and $e$ is the eccentricity. For a fantastic explanation of what these values mean, see here. Once $M$ is found, I can use a little trigonometry ($\\sin$ and $\\cos$, my old enemies) and a planets semi major and minor axises to find that planet's position in space. From there its just a bit of rendering math that Macroquad spared me from to get planets going in a ellipse.\nThe major issue of this approach is finding E. Kepler himself doubted the existence of closed form solution to his equation, and to this day no such solution has been found. Right now, the best we can do is use a variety of root finding algorithms to approach a true answer, but we can't ever guarantee that we have found a \"perfect\" solution. I chose to use Newton's method to solve this equation because I knew it from Calculus and it is relatively simple tio implement. \nHere is the full equation solver at the heart of the simulator:\nconst EPSILON: f64 = 0.000001;\nfn newtons_method&lt;F, G&gt;(x0: f64, fx: F, dx: G) -&gt; f64\n    where F: Fn(f64) -&gt; f64, G: Fn(f64) -&gt; f64 {\n    let mut root = x0;\n\n    loop {\n        let next_root = root - (fx(root) / dx(root));\n        let delta = f64::abs(next_root - root);\n        root = next_root;\n\n        if delta &lt;= EPSILON {\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    root\n}\n\nLets walk through it line by line:\nconst EPSILON: f64 = 0.000001;\n\nFor reasons unknown to me, epsilon is chosen to mean: \"some very small value\". I will not break mathematical tradition so epsilon is some very small value, in this case $\\frac{1}{1,000,000}$. Due to how Newton's method converges on a solution, when the changes to the guess start to be very small, we can be highly confident we are near a root. Epsilon controls how small my program considers \"small enough\".\nfn newtons_method&lt;F, G&gt;(x0: f64, fx: F, dx: G) -&gt; f64\n\nThis is Rust for: \"Define a function called newtons_method. It accepts three arguments called x0, fx, dx returns a decimal number.\" The &lt;F, G&gt; tells Rust, that newtons_method accepts arguments of any type and should call those types F and G.\nwhere F: Fn(f64) -&gt; f64, G: Fn(f64) -&gt; f64 {\n\nThis restricts what data type can be put into F and G to be: \"Any function which takes a decimal number as input, returns a decimal number as output.\"\nlet mut root = x0;\n\nMake a variable called root, assign x0 to it. Rust does not let variables change by default, so the mut before root lets root change. Newton's method requires an initial guess (often called $x_0$) the better this initial guess is, the faster Newton's method will converge to a root of the function.\nloop {\n\nDo whatever comes after me forever.\nlet next_root = root - (fx(root) / dx(root));\n\nthis is the Newton's method \"part\" of the algorithm. Newtons method is defined as $$x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$$. In english, the next guess is equal to the current guess minus f of the current guess over the derivative of f of the current guess.\nlet delta = f64::abs(next_root - root);\n\nCompute how far the new guess is from the previous guess. The abs is there because we only care about the distance on the number line.\nroot = next_root;\n\nset root to the next guess (next_root).\nif delta &lt;= EPSILON {\n    break;\n}\n\nI grouped these three lines, because they all act as one \"thing\". If the change (delta) is less than or equal to epsilon, stop the infinite loop.\nroot\n\nspit out what ever root was calculated.\nIn brief, this function can compute roots of any differentiable equation...eventually. Since Kepler's Equation is (in fact) an equation, Newton's method works for it!\nOnce we have this, solving for $E$ is as simple as: \nfn solve_keplers(mean_anomaly: f64, eccentricity: f64) -&gt; f64 {\n        let eccentric_anomaly = if eccentricity &gt; 0.8 { f64::PI() } else {mean_anomaly};\n        newtons_method(\n            eccentric_anomaly,\n            |eccentric_anomaly| Self::keplers_equation(mean_anomaly, eccentric_anomaly, eccentricity),\n            |eccentric_anomaly| Self::keplers_equation_derivation(eccentric_anomaly, eccentricity)\n        )\n    }\n\nYou might note at the top of the function, I guess that eccentric anomaly is either $\\pi$ or what ever the mean anomaly. This is the seed value for Newton's method ($x_0$). These specific starting values are recommended by Anderson, and have worked well for me.\n","id":"https://syst3mz.github.io/proof-of-work/","title":"Proof of work"},"https://syst3mz.github.io/resume/":{"body":"\n    Ethan W.
